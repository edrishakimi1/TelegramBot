# Telegram Bots

This projects serves as a means of testing and developing Telegram bots for OS1 2020 exercise

You need to create a file called **bot_token.txt** which contains your bot_token and place it in the root directory for the code to work.

The **bot_token.txt** -file should never be pushed into the repository for safety reasons. Our .gitignore -file should prevent this from happening.

The exercise base uses the **TelegramBot4s** -library by Alfonso Peterssen. We use the version 3 of the library for it's simpler structure.
You don't need to use the library directly if you use the course-provided helper functions, but in case you wnt to go further, version 3 can be found here:
